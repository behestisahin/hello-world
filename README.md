# hello-world
ok i created this because the guide says so.
Hello guys. I am pretty new in coding. I am just here because I am too curious. I have been studiying mechanical engineering for 7 years. So that means i am a bit stupid. But i do not care, I still want to learn more and have different experiences.
I still did not change unfortunately besides I learnt spanish pretty fluently. Enhorabuena a mi :D
